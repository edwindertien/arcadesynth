# arcadesynth
## intro
in this repository the design files of the arcade modular synth. 

The case started out as a laptop based arcade machine, but was converted to a modular rack with three sections. A gui (user interface) module has been designed to link arcade inputs (joysticks, switches) to analogue (0-5V) outputs to control other synth modules.

## design
### case
Files for the case design have been added. This is one big (cluttered) *.svg drawing and a picture for reference.
### gui
The pcb (electronics) and arduino firmware for a gui module linking 16 inputs (switches, analogue potentiometers etc) to 8 outputs (triggers, modulation, cv (pitch), LFO)
### furby
The fabulously furry synthesiser module designed for [FabAcademy 2024](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/waag/students/edwin-dertien/project/). Containing 3D print files for a small animatronic furby face, PCB (kicad) and software for RPi PICO
